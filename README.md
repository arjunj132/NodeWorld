# NodeWorld

NodeWorld is a series of apps for node powered by Electron.

## Run a app:
Running a app is easy. Just define the app:
```bash
APP='<the app>'
```
Check available apps in the `Apps` section and find the proper app's name.

And then run the command:

```bash
cd $APP; npm i; npm start; cd ..
```

To end the app, use ^C (<kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>)
